> A curated list of awesome [Electron](https://electronjs.org) alternatives.

[Electron](https://electronjs.org/) is an open-source framework for creating desktop apps using web technologies as JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It combines the [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org) rendering engine and the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) runtime.

There are a number of good reasons to avoid Electron or consider something other than Electron:
* Large size
* Resource (RAM) hogging
* [Source code protection](https://www.contextis.com/en/blog/basic-electron-framework-exploitation)
* We would already have a web component in the system that can be used.
* Electron apps cannot be submitted to the [Apple store](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21437255)
* [Minimal resources](https://github.com/Elanis/web-to-desktop-framework-comparison)

The primary job of a browser engine is to transform HTML documents and other resources of a web page into an interactive visual representation on a user's device. Besides "browser engine", two other related terms are commonly used: "layout engine" and "rendering engine". In theory, layout and rendering (or "painting") could be handled by different engines. In practice, however, these components are tightly coupled and rarely encountered on their own outside of the browser engine.

## 📚 Notes
Consider **Progressive Web Apps** [PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/desktop), if your app doesn't require any platform interactions.

> "Progressive Web Apps might not be able to replace every kind of native application, but they can be viable replacements for some apps written with the Electron web wrapper technology". For more info:
