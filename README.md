> A curated list of awesome [Electron](https://electronjs.org) alternatives.

[Electron](https://electronjs.org/) is an open-source framework for creating desktop apps using web technologies as JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It combines the [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org) rendering engine and the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) runtime.

There are a number of good reasons to avoid Electron or consider something other than Electron:
* Large size
* Resource (RAM) hogging
* [Source code protection](https://www.contextis.com/en/blog/basic-electron-framework-exploitation)
* We would already have a web component in the system that can be used.
* Electron apps cannot be submitted to the [Apple store](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21437255)
* [Minimal resources](https://github.com/Elanis/web-to-desktop-framework-comparison)
* Development platform like nodecode as Kodular, lowcode as Outsystems, database as a service as Astra DB, backend as service, mobile as a service, frontend as a service as Figma, banking as a service ...
* visual programming paradigm (this includes solutions or technologies like development platform, blockly, serverless, dbdiagram and programming language as elm, python, v ...)
* It is possible to develop games with Electron-js, but for good game development it is not recommended
* create data analysis and statistics with js libraries and electron-js for dashboards, however it is also not recommended

Besides "browser engine", two other related terms are commonly used: "layout engine" and "rendering engine". In theory, layout and rendering (or "painting") could be handled by different engines. In practice, however, these components are tightly coupled and rarely encountered on their own outside of the browser engine.
