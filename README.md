> A curated list of awesome [Electron](https://electronjs.org) alternatives.

[Electron](https://electronjs.org/) is an open-source framework for creating desktop apps using web technologies as JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It combines the [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org) rendering engine and the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) runtime.

There are a number of good reasons to avoid Electron or consider something other than Electron:
* Large size
* Resource (RAM) hogging
* [Source code protection](https://www.contextis.com/en/blog/basic-electron-framework-exploitation)
* We would already have a web component in the system that can be used.
* Electron apps cannot be submitted to the [Apple store](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21437255)
* [Minimal resources](https://github.com/Elanis/web-to-desktop-framework-comparison)
* Development platform like nodecode as Kodular, lowcode as Outsystems, database as a service as Astra DB, backend as service, mobile as a service, frontend as a service as Figma, banking as a service ...
* visual programming paradigm (this includes solutions or technologies like development platform, blockly, serverless, dbdiagram and programming language as elm, python, v ...)
* It is possible to develop games with Electron-js, but for good game development it is not recommended
* create data analysis and statistics with js libraries and electron-js for dashboards, however it is also not recommended

In practice, however, these components are tightly coupled and rarely encountered on their own outside of the browser engine.
