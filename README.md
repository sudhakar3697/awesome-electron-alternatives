> A curated list of awesome [Electron](https://electronjs.org) alternatives.

[Electron](https://electronjs.org/) is an open-source framework for creating desktop apps using web technologies as JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It combines the [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org) rendering engine and the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) runtime.

There are a number of good reasons to avoid Electron or consider something other than Electron:
* Large size
* Resource (RAM) hogging
* [Source code protection](https://www.contextis.com/en/blog/basic-electron-framework-exploitation)
* We would already have a web component in the system that can be used.
* Electron apps cannot be submitted to the [Apple store](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21437255)
* [Minimal resources](https://github.com/Elanis/web-to-desktop-framework-comparison)
* You don't like the idea of a monopoly on software development whether through some framework, programming language, community, technology, company, operating system or on a specific software license. Or you are a curious person who always wants to learn something new. Or you use a js runtime like deno, baun or another that does not work correctly in electron-js. Or you created a specific JS runtime that doesn't work with electron-js.
* You want to create your own development platform like nocode(Kodular, Bubble...), lowcode(Zoho Creator, Outsystems...)... Or you feel stuck, pressured into one or more of these types of development platforms. Or most of these development platforms work online on the web and are cross-platform, there is not much need to have a desktop version. So you feel unmotivated to create a desktop solution with electron-js or any similar framework, because you are used to the user experience on websites, webapps and applications on smartphones.
* There are several rendering engines(gecko, khtml ...) or operating systems(haiku, amiga-os, redox-os ...) that electron-js does not support. And If you want to use these rendering engines or operating systems you would have to do a lot of portability work. Furthermore, you do not agree with the software license provided by electron-js or the way electron-js is built. 
* You work with cloud computing models or specific business models, such as serverless, Astra DB (database as a service), backend as a service, mobile as a service, frontend as a service, open core, freepremium, subscription model ... and most of these cloud computing models or business models work online on the web and are cross-platform. There is not much need to have a desktop version too.
*  You or your software development team are locked into a narrow set of solutions, frameworks, softwares, development platforms, programming paradigms(dataflow, visual, business oriented), technologies or programming language such as 8th, Xojo, Livecode, cobol, opencobol, netcobol, delphi, dbdiagram, r, julia, prograph, joule ...
* It is possible to develop games with Electron-js, but for good game development it is not recommended
* create data analysis and statistics with js libraries and electron-js for dashboards, however it is also not recommended

However, to be sure we're all in sync: the GUI is designed to make simple apps simple, and sophisticated apps possible. That is, you really can write a useful app in just a few lines of GUI dialect, and a full scale app may require just a few dozen pages.
   
### [Red](https://www.red-lang.org/p/about.html)
* [Drawing](https://github.com/red/docs/blob/master/en/draw.adoc): Draw is a dialect (DSL) of Red language that provides a simple declarative way to specify 2D drawing operations. Such operations are expressed as lists of ordered commands (using blocks of values), which can be freely constructed and changed at run-time.
* [Native GUI](https://github.com/red/docs/blob/master/en/view.adoc): The Red/View (or just View) component is a graphic system for the Red programming language.

### Tk\tcl
* [Tk\Tcl](https://www.tcl.tk/): Software developers are more productive with the help of Tcl programming language and Tk graphical user interface toolkit.
  
### V
* [ui](https://github.com/pisaiah/ui): Isaiah's cross-platform GUI library for V. Inspired by the syntax of Java's Swing.

* [Comparison of Browser Engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_browser_engines): A browser engine (also known as a layout engine or rendering engine) is a core software component of every major web browser. The primary job of a browser engine is to transform HTML documents and other resources of a web page into an interactive visual representation on a user's device. Besides "browser engine", two other related terms are commonly used: "layout engine" and "rendering engine". In theory, layout and rendering (or "painting") could be handled by different engines. In practice, however, these components are tightly coupled and rarely encountered on their own outside of the browser engine.

In today’s software development world, these languages are now indispensable. As the JavaScript ecosystem grows, developers frequently raise the question of which runtime is best. We compare three leading competitors, Bun, Node.js, and Deno, to decide which has the best runtime and assess their strengths and limitations in terms of security, ecosystem, performance, and package systems so you decide when and why you should choose one of these runtimes over the others. There is even an open source project that makes a series of comparisons with the js runtime [bench](https://github.com/denosaurs/bench) (Comparing deno, node and bun HTTP frameworks).

## 📚 Notes
Today there are more opportunities for software development on the web or natively on smartphones than desktop versions. Look at the current data on the number of mobile devices or devices that access the internet: [Internet Live Stats](https://www.internetlivestats.com/), [Statista & Smartphones](https://www.statista.com/topics/840/smartphones/), [ExplodingTopics & Smartphone Stats](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/smartphone-stats) and here [Stackoverlflow Developer Survey Results 2019](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019/). Using electron-js depends a lot on each case. From a financial and business perspective, it is better to build a website or app than a desktop version. Although you may have a contrary opinion on finding it easier to create prototypes or softwares with a desktop version. 

But this list is provided for informational purposes. The inclusion of any programming language, design pattern or tool as an alternative to electron-js does not imply endorsement or recommendation. Users are advised to conduct their own research before choosing a programming language or alternative to electron-js for their specific needs. That said, consider these alternatives:
* **[HTA/HTML Application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_Application):** *"HTML Application or "HTA" is a Microsoft Windows program whose source code consists of HTML, Dynamic HTML, and one or more scripting languages supported by Internet Explorer, such as VBScript or JScript. The HTML is used to generate the user interface, and the scripting language is used for the program logic. An HTA executes without the constraints of the internet browser security model; in fact, it executes as a "fully trusted" application."*
* [CEF](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/workspace/repositories/): *"Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF). A simple framework for embedding Chromium-based browsers in other applications written in Java, .Net/Mono, Delphi, Haskell, Go, Python, Avalonia/WPF."*
* **Progressive Web Apps:** [PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/desktop), if your app doesn't require any platform interactions. For more info see this: [Blazor](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2019/09/26/blazor-future.aspx), [ElectronCGI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-cgi) and this info *"Progressive Web Apps might not be able to replace every kind of native application, but they can be viable replacements for some apps written with the Electron web wrapper technology"* [here](https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/05/27/google-chats-desktop-application-is-now-a-progressive-web-app/).
